# 🚧 Predictive Maintenance Analytics for Mining Equipment

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predictive maintenance analytics** for mining equipment using **Python** and **Power BI**. The goal is to identify failure patterns, high‑risk assets, and operational drivers of downtime in order to support **data‑driven maintenance decisions** and reduce production losses.

The dataset represents **1,200 mining equipment units**, covering failures, downtime, equipment types, operational age, and maintenance load.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

Unplanned equipment failures in mining operations lead to:

* High downtime costs
* Lost production
* Inefficient maintenance planning

This project aims to:

* Detect **high‑risk equipment**
* Understand **failure drivers**
* Quantify **downtime and production loss impact**
* Enable a shift from **reactive to predictive maintenance**

---

## 📊 Key Results & Insights

* **1,200** total equipment units analyzed
* **138 failures** recorded
* **1,104 hours** of estimated downtime
* **54.37K tons** of estimated production loss
* **85 high‑risk assets** identified
* Excavators show the **highest failure rate and downtime impact**

These insights highlight strong opportunities for targeted maintenance interventions.

## 📈 Dashboard Structure (Power BI)

### 🟦 Page 1 – Executive Overview

* KPI cards:

  * Total Equipment
  * Failed Equipment
  * Failure Rate (%)
  * High‑Risk Equipment Count
  * Estimated Downtime (Hours)
  * Estimated Production Loss (Tons)
* High‑level business insight summary

### 🟦 Page 2 – Failure Drivers

* Failure rate by:

  * Equipment Type
  * Operational Age Group
  * Maintenance Load

This page helps identify **why failures occur**.

### 🟦 Page 3 – Operational Insights

* Downtime by Equipment Type
* High‑Risk Equipment table (Top assets by risk)
* Actionable view for maintenance prioritization

---

## 🧠 High‑Risk Equipment Logic

An equipment unit is classified as **High Risk** based on:

* Failure probability
* Estimated downtime impact

This allows maintenance teams to prioritize assets with the highest operational risk.
